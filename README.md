# shymr - The ML marketplace.

**Shymr** is a peer-to-peer platform that enables both individuals and teams to exchange access to compute power, datasets, and models thorugh a comprehensive, community driven marketplace. Users can allocate personal hardware capacity to others, or list their compiled models and data to others. Shymr allows others to gain resources shared by the community, all under an organized policy and clearly defined pricing. We facilitate collaboration by allowing users to request datasets or workflows through forums, connecting them directly with developers to fulfill those needs. Every interaction on Shymr is through the community, ensuring ML engineers make advances **together.**
