# shymr - The ML marketplace.

**Shymr** is a P2P platform that enables both individuals and teams to exchange access to compute power, datasets, and models thorugh a comprehensive, community driven marketplace. Users can allocate personal hardware capacity to others, or list their compiled models and data to others. Shymr allows others to gain resources shared by the community, all under an organized policy and clearly defined pricing. We facilitate collaboration by allowing users to request datasets or workflows through forums, connecting them directly with developers to fulfill those needs. Every interaction on Shymr is through the community, ensuring ML engineers make advances **together.**

*Note: While this U.I is still in development and remains front-end only right now, we are rapidly working towards full functionality.

So why not choose to use AWS, or other larger commercial alternatives? AWS pricing includes infrastructure, margins, redundancy, sales, and other fees that can cause
pricing to become astronomically high for the ccompute you are using. Shymr's P2P system allows prices to trend towards real marginal cost, resulting
in 2x-10x lower prices on average. This system is called Shymr **airTime**. Runtimes run directly on other user's hardware that you purchase per TFLOP of compute.
Sellers choose their pricing based on a variety of factors which they can adjust, however they are locked in a certain range based on the GPU's detected in their
system to maintain reasonable pricing. And the best part- If for some reason the user decides to shut their machine off, or anything else that would cancel your process,
you are administered a full refund.
